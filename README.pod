=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a simple L<Plack>/PSGI version of the L<RapidApp>/L<RapidDbic|Catalyst::Plugin::RapidApp::RapidDbic> 
"Chinook" demo at L<http://www.rapidapp.info/demos/chinook>. This module was written to allow CPAN 
distribution of the demo for easy access and portability within PSGI-based setups.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

C<Rapi::Demo::Chinook> extends L<RapidApp::Builder> and supports all of its options, as well as the 
following params specific to this module:

=head2 chinook_db

Path to the SQLite database file, which may or may not already exist. If the file does not already
exist, it is created as a copy from the default database, which is the state of the DB at the end
of "Part 2" of the Chinook demo at L<http://www.rapidapp.info/demos/chinook>.

Defaults to C<'chinook.db'> in the current working directory.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 init_db

Copies the default database to the path specified by C<chinook_db>. Pass a true value as the first
argument to overwrite the target file if it already exists.

This method is called automatically the first time the module is loaded, or if the C<chinook_db> file
doesn't exist.
